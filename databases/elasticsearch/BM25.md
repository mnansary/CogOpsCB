Of course. For a purely local development environment where you want zero friction, we can disable all security features for Elasticsearch, including both TLS and password authentication.

This guide provides the complete, fresh instructions for deploying a fully insecure, open Elasticsearch instance.

### **Development-Grade Elasticsearch Deployment (No Security)**

**Objective:** To deploy a persistent, completely insecure Elasticsearch server for local development. This setup removes all encryption and password layers for maximum simplicity and ease of access.

**Security Posture:**
*   **No TLS/SSL:** All traffic is in plaintext (HTTP).
*   **No Password:** The API is completely open to any client that can reach the port. This is **highly insecure and suitable only for a trusted local machine.**
*   **Network Isolation:** The service port (`9200`) will still be bound to `localhost` as a final safety measure.

### **Step 1: Complete Cleanup of Previous Deployments**

It is critical to remove all remnants of the previous secure setups to ensure a clean start.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /elasticsearch-secure

# 1. Stop and remove the container, its network, and its persistent data volume (-v).
sudo docker compose down -v

# 2. Delete the secret files that are no longer needed.
sudo rm -rf secrets/
```

### **Step 2: Create Project Structure and Set Permissions**

The structure is now very simple, but we still need to set the correct permissions for the data directory.

```bash
# 1. Re-create the directory structure (if you deleted the parent).
sudo mkdir -p /elasticsearch-secure/data

# 2. Set ownership for the Elasticsearch user (UID/GID 1000).
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /elasticsearch-secure/data
```

### **Step 3: Create the Final, Insecure Docker Compose File**

This is the most minimal configuration possible. We will explicitly disable the X-Pack security module.

**Replace the entire contents** of `/elasticsearch-secure/docker-compose.yml` with the following:

```yaml
# /elasticsearch-secure/docker-compose.yml
# COMPLETELY INSECURE ELASTICSEARCH DEPLOYMENT (FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY)

services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: elasticsearch:8.15.1
    container_name: elastic_local_insecure
    restart: unless-stopped

    # Bind the HTTP port only to localhost.
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:9200:9200"

    volumes:
      - ./data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data

    environment:
      # --- Cluster Setup ---
      - discovery.type=single-node

      # --- THIS IS THE KEY CHANGE ---
      # Explicitly disable all security features (password, TLS, etc.).
      - xpack.security.enabled=false

      # --- Performance Tuning ---
      - "ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms1g -Xmx1g"

    healthcheck:
      # The check is now a simple, unauthenticated HTTP request.
      test: >
        [ "CMD-SHELL", "curl -s http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health |
          grep -q '\"status\":\"green\|yellow\"'" ]
      interval: 20s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5

# NOTE: There is no 'secrets:' block in this file.
```

### **Step 4: Launch and Verify the Service**

The startup should be slightly faster without the security module initializing.

```bash
# Ensure you are in the /elasticsearch-secure directory
cd /elasticsearch-secure

# 1. Start the service.
sudo docker compose up -d

# 2. Check the status. Wait for it to become 'running (healthy)'.
sudo docker compose ps
```

### **Step 5: Connecting to Your Insecure Instance**

The client connection is now as simple as possible.

1.  **Install the library (if needed):**
    `pip install elasticsearch==8.15.1`

2.  **Create and run the simplest Python script (`test_elastic_insecure_connection.py`):**
    ```python
    from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

    print("Attempting to connect to insecure Elasticsearch server...")

    try:
        # Client connects to 'http' and requires no authentication or certificates.
        client = Elasticsearch("http://localhost:9200")

        # Ping the cluster to verify the connection is active
        if client.ping():
            print("\n✅ Connection successful!")
            
            # Get and print basic cluster info
            info = client.info()
            print(f"   Cluster Name: {info['cluster_name']}")
            print(f"   Elasticsearch Version: {info['version']['number']}")
        else:
            print("\n❌ Connection failed. The ping was unsuccessful. Check container status.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n❌ An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    ```

You have now successfully deployed a completely open Elasticsearch instance for your local development. This completes the setup for all the data services in your architecture.
