Of course. My apologies for the incomplete response. Here is the complete, professional guide for deploying a development-grade Redis instance.

---

### **Development-Grade Redis Deployment via Docker**

**Objective:** To deploy a persistent, non-secure Redis server for local development. All data will reside in `/redis-secure/`, and the service will be accessible from the host machine (`localhost`).

**Security Posture:**
*   **No TLS/SSL:** All network traffic will be in plaintext.
*   **No Password:** Any client that can reach the port can issue commands.
*   **Network Isolation:** The service will still be bound to `localhost` as a best practice to prevent accidental network exposure.

---

### **Step 1: Stop and Clean Up the Previous Secure Deployment**

It is crucial to remove the old container and its associated volumes and secrets to avoid any conflicts.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /redis-secure

# 1. Stop and completely remove the services, volumes, and networks
# defined in the previous docker-compose file.
sudo docker compose down -v

# 2. Clean up the configuration and secret files that are no longer needed.
sudo rm -rf secrets/ certificates/ .env
```
This ensures you have a completely clean slate for the new, simpler configuration.

---

### **Step 2: Create the Simplified `docker-compose.yml` File**

This configuration is minimal. It defines the Redis service, a persistent data volume, and disables password protection.

**Replace the entire contents** of your `/redis-secure/docker-compose.yml` file with the following:

```yaml
# /redis-secure/docker-compose.yml
# DEVELOPMENT-ONLY (INSECURE) CONFIGURATION

services:
  redis:
    # We can use the official redis image or bitnami, both work for this.
    # The official image is slightly more lightweight.
    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: redis_local_dev
    restart: unless-stopped

    # As a best practice, still bind to localhost to prevent accidental exposure.
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:6379:6379"

    volumes:
      # Map the persistent data directory. The internal path is different for the official image.
      - ./data:/data

    healthcheck:
      # The healthcheck is now a simple PING command.
      test: [ "CMD", "redis-cli", "ping" ]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
```

**Key Changes:**
*   **Image:** Switched to the lightweight official `redis:7-alpine` image.
*   **No Security:** All `environment`, `secrets`, and certificate `volumes` have been removed. The official Redis image runs without a password by default.
*   **Data Volume Path:** The internal data path for the official image is `/data`.
*   **Healthcheck:** Simplified to a basic `ping` command, as no authentication or TLS is needed.

### **Step 3: Launch and Verify the Service**

Now, start the new, simplified container.

```bash
# Ensure you are still in the /redis-secure directory
cd /redis-secure

# 1. Start the service in the background.
sudo docker compose up -d

# 2. Check the status. It should start quickly and become healthy.
sudo docker compose ps
```
The status should show `running (healthy)` within a few seconds.

### **Step 4: Connecting to Your Insecure Instance**

Connecting to this instance is straightforward as there are no security hurdles.

Here is the updated Python script to test the connection.

1.  **Install the library (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    pip install redis
    ```

2.  **Create and run a Python script (`test_redis_dev_connection.py`):**
    ```python
    import redis

    print("Attempting to connect to insecure (development) Redis server...")

    try:
        # Connection requires no password and no SSL/TLS parameters.
        r = redis.Redis(
            host='localhost',
            port=6379,
            decode_responses=True # Optional: makes responses strings instead of bytes
        )

        # Ping the server to confirm the connection is active
        response = r.ping()
        
        if response:
            print("\n✅ Connection successful!")
            
            # Perform a basic SET and GET to verify functionality
            r.set('dev_test', 'success')
            value = r.get('dev_test')
            
            print(f"   Server PING response: {response}")
            print(f"   Successfully SET and GET key 'dev_test' with value: '{value}'")
        else:
            print("\n❌ Connection appeared to succeed, but PING failed.")

    except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as e:
        print("\n❌ Connection failed. Check if the server is running and the port is correct.")
        print(f"   Error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n❌ An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
    ```

This setup provides a functional, persistent Redis database for your local development needs.
