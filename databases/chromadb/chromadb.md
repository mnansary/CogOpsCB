Of course. We can absolutely simplify the ChromaDB deployment by removing the Caddy reverse proxy and all security layers. This is a very common approach for a purely local development environment where the primary goal is to get the service running quickly and easily.

This guide provides the complete, fresh instructions, starting with a thorough cleanup of the previous secure setup.

### **Development-Grade ChromaDB Deployment (Insecure)**

**Objective:** To deploy a simple, persistent, server-based ChromaDB instance for local development. This setup removes all encryption and authentication layers for ease of use.

**Security Posture:**
*   **No Caddy Proxy:** The ChromaDB service will be exposed directly.
*   **No TLS/SSL:** All network traffic will be in plaintext (HTTP).
*   **No Authentication:** The API is open to any client that can reach the port.
*   **Network Isolation:** As a safety best practice, the service will still be bound to `localhost` to prevent accidental exposure to your local network.

---

### **Step 1: Complete Cleanup of the Secure Deployment**

First, we will stop and completely remove the Caddy and Chroma containers, along with their associated volumes and configuration files, to ensure a clean slate.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /chroma-secure

# 1. Stop and remove the containers, and crucially, the persistent data volume (-v flag).
sudo docker compose down -v

# 2. Delete the configuration files that are no longer needed for this setup.
sudo rm -rf Caddyfile/ certificates/
```
This leaves you with just the `/chroma-secure` directory and its empty `data` subdirectory, ready for the new configuration.

---

### **Step 2: Create the Simplified `docker-compose.yml` File**

This configuration is minimal. It defines only the ChromaDB service and exposes its port directly to your `localhost`.

**Replace the entire contents** of your `/chroma-secure/docker-compose.yml` file with the following:

```yaml
# /chroma-secure/docker-compose.yml
# DEVELOPMENT-ONLY (INSECURE) CONFIGURATION

services:
  chroma:
    image: chromadb/chroma:0.5.3
    container_name: chroma_local_dev
    restart: unless-stopped

    # Security: Expose the ChromaDB port directly, but only to localhost.
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8443:8000"

    volumes:
      # Map the persistent data directory.
      - ./data:/chroma/chroma

    environment:
      - IS_PERSISTENT=TRUE
      - ALLOW_RESET=TRUE

    healthcheck:
      # The healthcheck now directly queries the container's internal port.
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8443/api/v1/heartbeat"]
      interval: 15s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
```
**Key Changes:**
*   **Single Service:** The `caddy` service has been completely removed.
*   **Direct Port Exposure:** The `chroma` service now has a `ports` section, binding the container's port `8000` to your host machine's `localhost:8000`.
*   **Simplicity:** No certificate volumes, no complex proxy logic.

### **Step 3: Launch and Verify the Service**

Now, start the new, simplified container.

```bash
# Ensure you are still in the /chroma-secure directory
cd /chroma-secure

# 1. Start the service in the background.
sudo docker compose up -d

# 2. Check the status. It should start quickly and become healthy.
sudo docker compose ps
```
You should see a single container named `chroma_local_dev` with a status of `running (healthy)` and a port mapping of `127.0.0.1:8000->8000/tcp`.

---

### **Step 4: Connecting to Your Insecure ChromaDB Instance**

Connecting to this instance is now much simpler. The client does not need to handle SSL/TLS.

1.  **Install the library (if needed):**
    `pip install chromadb==0.5.3`

2.  **Create and run the simplified Python script (`test_chroma_dev_connection.py`):**
    ```python
    import chromadb
    import uuid

    print("Attempting to connect to insecure (development) ChromaDB server...")

    try:
        # Connection is now a simple HTTP call.
        # No 'ssl=True' and no 'settings' object are needed.
        client = chromadb.HttpClient(host='localhost', port=8000)

        # Verify the connection by checking the heartbeat
        version = client.version()
        print(f"\n✅ Connection successful!")
        print(f"   ChromaDB Version: {version}")

        # Perform a basic operation to confirm functionality
        collection_name = f"dev_test_{uuid.uuid4().hex}"
        collection = client.get_or_create_collection(name=collection_name)
        
        collection.add(
            documents=["This is a test of a simple, insecure connection."],
            ids=["id1"]
        )
        
        results = collection.query(query_texts=["simple test"], n_results=1)
        
        print(f"   Successfully created and queried collection '{collection_name}'.")
        print(f"   Query results: {results['documents'][0]}")
        
        # Clean up the test collection
        client.delete_collection(name=collection_name)
        print(f"   Successfully deleted test collection.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n❌ An unexpected error occurred. Is the ChromaDB container running?")
        print(f"   Error: {e}")
    ```

You now have a fully functional, persistent ChromaDB instance running for your local development needs, with all the complexity of TLS and proxying removed.
