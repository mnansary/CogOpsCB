### **Deploying a Conflict-Free Local ChromaDB with Docker**

**Objective:** To set up a reliable, persistent ChromaDB container for local development. This guide is designed for a new setup and uses a specific network configuration to ensure it does not clash with VPNs or other local networks.

**Core Strategy:** We will define a custom Docker network using the `10.10.1.0/24` subnet. This private IP range is rarely used by default in home or corporate environments, making it a safe choice to avoid the conflicts often seen with the `172.x.x.x` series.

---

### **Step 1: Create the Project Directory Structure**

We will organize all our files within a dedicated `~/database/chromadb` directory.

1.  **Create the necessary directories.** The `-p` flag will create parent directories (`database`) if they don't already exist.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/database/chromadb
    ```

2.  **Navigate into your new project directory.** All subsequent commands will be run from this location.
    ```bash
    cd ~/database/chromadb
    ```

Your project is now staged in a clean, fixed location. The persistent database files will be automatically created inside a `chroma_data` folder within this directory upon the first launch.

---

### **Step 2: Create the `docker-compose.yml` Configuration File**

This file is the blueprint for our ChromaDB service. It tells Docker exactly what to build, how to network it, and where to store its data.

Create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` inside the `database/chromadb` directory and paste the following content into it:

```yaml
# /database/chromadb/docker-compose.yml
# A ROBUST AND CONFLICT-FREE CHROMA DEPLOYMENT
services:
  chroma:
    image: "chromadb/chroma:0.5.3"
    container_name: chroma_local_dev
    restart: unless-stopped

    # --- Port Mapping ---
    # Binds the container's internal port 8000 to port 8000 on your local machine.
    # The '127.0.0.1' ensures it is only accessible from your computer, not the wider network.
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8443:8000"

    # --- Data Persistence ---
    # Maps a folder named 'chroma_data' in your current directory to the data directory inside the container.
    # This ensures your database data persists even if the container is removed.
    volumes:
      - ./chroma_data:/chroma/chroma

    environment:
      - IS_PERSISTENT=TRUE
      - ALLOW_RESET=TRUE

    healthcheck:
      # This check runs inside the container and confirms the service is responsive.
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8443/api/v1/heartbeat"]
      interval: 15s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

    # --- Custom Networking ---
    # Connects this service to our conflict-free network defined below.
    networks:
      - chroma-net

# --- Conflict-Free Network Definition ---
networks:
  chroma-net:
    driver: bridge
    ipam: # IP Address Management
      driver: default
      config:
        # We define a custom subnet in the 10.x.x.x range to avoid conflicts
        # with common VPN (172.x) and home (192.168.x) networks.
        - subnet: "10.10.1.0/24"
          gateway: "10.10.1.1"

```

---

### **Step 3: Launch and Verify the Service**

With the configuration in place, you can now launch the container.

1.  **Start the service in the background.** Ensure you are in the `~/database/chromadb` directory.
    ```bash
    sudo docker compose up -d
    ```

2.  **Check the container's status.** After a few moments, the status should change from `starting` to `running (healthy)`.
    ```bash
    sudo docker compose ps
    ```
    *Expected Output:*
    ```
    NAME                IMAGE                    COMMAND                  SERVICE             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS
    chroma_local_dev    chromadb/chroma:0.5.3    "/docker-entrypoint.…"   chroma              ...                 Up ... (healthy)         127.0.0.1:8443->8000/tcp
    ```

3.  **Verify the custom network (Recommended).** This command confirms that Docker has successfully created the network with your specific IP range.
    ```bash
    # The network name is prefixed with the project directory name, 'chromadb'
    sudo docker network inspect chromadb_chroma-net
    ```
    In the JSON output, look for the `IPAM` section to confirm the subnet is `10.10.1.0/24`. This is your guarantee against network conflicts.

### **Step 4: Connect to and Test Your ChromaDB Instance**

Finally, run a Python script to confirm you can connect to the server and that it's fully operational.

1.  **Install the ChromaDB client library** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    pip install chromadb==0.5.3
    ```

2.  **Create a test script.** create a file named `test_connection.py` with the following code:
    ```python
    import chromadb
    import uuid

    print("--- Attempting to connect to ChromaDB server at localhost:8443 ---")

    try:
        # Connect to the ChromaDB server running on your local machine
        client = chromadb.HttpClient(host='localhost', port=8443)
        client.heartbeat()
        print("✅ Connection successful!")

        # --- Perform a full create-read-query-delete cycle ---
        collection_name = f"test_collection_{uuid.uuid4().hex}"
        print(f"\n--- Running test with collection: '{collection_name}' ---")

        collection = client.get_or_create_collection(name=collection_name)
        print("   - Step 1: Collection created successfully.")

        collection.add(
            documents=["This is a test document from a conflict-free setup."],
            ids=["id1"]
        )
        print("   - Step 2: Document added successfully.")

        results = collection.query(query_texts=["test document"], n_results=1)
        print("   - Step 3: Query executed successfully.")
        
        # Verify the result
        if "conflict-free setup" in results['documents'][0][0]:
             print("   - Step 4: Document content verified successfully.")
        else:
            raise ValueError("Query returned unexpected result.")

        # Clean up the test collection
        client.delete_collection(name=collection_name)
        print(f"   - Step 5: Test collection deleted successfully.")

        print("\n--- ✅ All operations completed successfully! Your ChromaDB instance is ready. ---")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n❌ An error occurred. Please check the following:")
        print("   1. Is the ChromaDB container running? Run 'sudo docker compose ps' to check.")
        print(f"   2. Error details: {e}")
    ```

3.  **Run the script.**
    ```bash
    python test_connection.py
    ```

Upon successful execution, you will see a series of confirmation messages. You now have a persistent, stable, and conflict-free ChromaDB instance ready for your development projects.
